Solution using dynamique programming 

Dynamic Programming
1-Create a table of size (n+1) * (capacity+1) consisting of all 0s, where is n is the number of elements.
table[i][c] represents the maximum profit that can be obtained using the first i elements if the maximum
capacity is c. Here's a visual representation of a filled table (source - geeksforgeeks):
(The 0th row will contain all zeros and is not shown above.)

2-We'll fill the table row by row and column by column. table[i][c] can be filled using some values in the row above it.

3-If weights[i] > c i.e. if the current element can is larger than capacity, then table[i+1][c] is simply 
equal to table[i][c] (since there's no way we can pick this element).

4-If weights[i] <= c then we have two choices: to either pick the current element or not to get the value of table[i+1][c].
We can compare the maximum profit for both these options and pick the better one as the value of table[i][c].
A. If we don't pick the element with weight weights[i], then once again the maximum profit is table[i][c]
B. If we pick the element with weight weights[i], then the maximum profit is profits[i] + table[i][c-weights[i]],
since we have used up some capacity.

Verify that the complexity of the dynamic programming solution is 
O(Nâˆ—W).
